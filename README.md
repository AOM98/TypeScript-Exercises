## Overview

I'm currently using the main exercises which are on the "mentored path", these are recommended because they're more likely to hit all the critical spots. The optional exercises will be noted as *(optional)*.

I will be solving every exercise twice (if necessary) once where I have an original self made solution, second is an optimized solution after looking at the community answers and understanding the way they optimized, which will be further explained.

## Exercises

The list of exercises is ordered as listed in the mentored path, of course you can go to multiple different ones and cherry pick if you like.
I will be giving tricks learned or shorter codes under each exercises if i find it fitting.

## Brief Description

A repository of solutions to typescript exercises from a collection of websites!

This repository includes **Medium+** exercises that I have solved from many websites that include exercises.

Each website includes:

- A general review
- How beginner friendly the content is
- Is the website/setup user friendly
- Tests performed on the exercise
- Finding optimal/different solutions

The websites will their own branch (if there is an exception, it'll be mentioned under website below), and will be merged when the content of the website has been completed.

***Please Note:*** I'm not a professional TS developer, this is my personal opinion on the websites as I go through the learning journey.

## Websites

The following websites are ordered in the sequence that I have accessed and finished them. You will find a ranking on a criteria at the bottom of every website. A table will be provided when more material has been collected.

### Exercism (on going)

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks) is a great website to start learning a language, especially since it includes many community solutions and mentorship when needed.
The [Type-Script](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/typescript) track is useful, I believe it's great for beginners for the points raised above.
